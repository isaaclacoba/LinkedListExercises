# Linked List Exercise

## Introduction

This exercise tries to help to understand one of the most basics data structure: the linked list.

## Exercises

So far we are focusing on the most basic data structure: Linked List.
You can find two branches in this project: one for single linked list and another for double linked list.

The code tries to guide you through the exercises as we explore different aspect of this data estructure. At the same time, we'll try to show some common design patters broadly used in the industry.

## Before starting the programming...

**Reading**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list


## Now, let's code!
Open the file *main.cpp* inside the folder LinkedList. This file contains a set of asserts. If you complete the steps succesfully, it will execute sucessfully. Otherwise, you'll a failure after running the binary.

By default, main.cpp has an empty function *create_list_with_two_elements* which receives two integers, 1 and 2. Your task is to fill that function with you own implementation of *single linked list*, build and execute the program.

If you are successful, you'll see the next output:

```
check_list_got_two_elements...size of the list: 2 - Expected: 2
Success!!
check_if_first_element_is_1...First element of the list: 1 - Expected: 1
Success!!
check_if_second_element_is_2...Second element of the list: 2 - Expected: 2
Success!!
```

Good luck!!

## How to compile and run the example?
```
$ cd LinkedList;
$ python3 ../mach/mach.py build
$ python3 ../mach/mach.py run
```
