# Linked List Exercise

## Introduction

This exercise tries to help to understand one of the most basics data structure: the linked list.

## Before starting the programming...

**Reading**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list


## Now, let's code!
Open the file *main.cpp* inside the folder LinkedList. This file contains a set of asserts. If you complete the steps succesfully, it will execute sucessfully. Otherwise, you'll a failure after running the binary.

By default, main.cpp has an empty function *create_list_with_two_elements* which receives two integers, 1 and 2. Your task is to fill that function with you own implementation of *single linked list*, build and execute the program.

If you are successful, you'll see the next output:

```
check_list_got_two_elements...size of the list: 2 - Expected: 2
Success!!
check_if_first_element_is_1...First element of the list: 1 - Expected: 1
Success!!
check_if_second_element_is_2...Second element of the list: 2 - Expected: 2
Success!!
```

Good luck!!

## How to compile and run the example?
```
$ cd LinkedList;
$ python3 ../mach/mach.py build
$ python3 ../mach/mach.py run
```
